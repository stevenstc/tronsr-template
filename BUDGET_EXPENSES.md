el 20% se usa para aumentar el valor compuesto del token BRST para aumentar el valor del token con respecto a TRX


The idea is to use the majority of the Tronix that is earned as Super Representative to go back into Tron ecosystem, no Tronix will be withdrawn for my own benefit in the first year. 

All Tronix will be used in the first year for the following
* Tron will be used to increase hardware capacity for my SR slot.
* As hardware capacity needs are met then the amounts of Tronix retained will be less and more will be given to the community. Ideally if    future Tron explorer shows who votes for my SR I would like to payout Tronix to these voters to the proportion of the Tronix used to      vote.
* I will immediately start sharing with Tron community when in top 27 and creating blocks. Within 1-2 month from launch my share percentage will increase drastically to be sharing up to 86% of Tron with ecosystem in the form of **85% with voters, 1%** with loyal voters. Small % to donate to development projects within ecosystem. 
* Any Tron remaining will be left in Tron network for future funding. No Tronix will be withdrawn for my own benefit in the first year.
